This is a port of version 0.2a of mpglib to RISC OS.

See the various files in this archive for licensing terms.

This library has been modified to get it to build on RISC OS.
Everything that has been changed is wrapped in

#ifdef RISCOS
#endif

constructs.

Most of the changes relate to definitions or the referencing of
include files that are not relevant to RISC OS.

Note that the makefiles are autogenerated from Sourcery, they
will require changes to work on the system they are being
built on. This should just mean that some paths need changing.
